# AeroChain Bag Tracking

Introduction
AeroChain Bag Tracking is a blockchain-based project that aims to revolutionize baggage tracking and luggage management in the airline industry. By leveraging the power of blockchain technology, we provide a decentralized and transparent system that enhances the security, traceability, and efficiency of baggage handling.

**Features**<br>
***
1. Baggage Tracking: Our system enables real-time tracking of luggage from the moment it is checked in until it reaches its final destination. Passengers and airlines can easily locate and monitor the status of their bags throughout the journey.
2. Secure and Immutable: By utilizing blockchain technology, we ensure that all baggage-related data, such as check-in records, transfers, and delivery, are securely stored and tamper-proof. This enhances trust and eliminates the risk of data manipulation.
3. Efficient Baggage Management: Our solution streamlines the baggage handling process, reducing errors and delays. Airlines can easily manage and update the status of each bag, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
4. Smart Contracts: We employ smart contracts to automate and enforce predefined rules and conditions for baggage handling. This ensures transparency and accountability in the interactions between passengers, airlines, and other stakeholders.
5. User-Friendly Interface: Our user-friendly interface allows passengers to easily track their luggage using a web-based application. Airlines can also access the system to manage baggage-related operations efficiently.
